3. **Small amount of BTC** — For transaction fees on Mezo Network

### Don't have veBTC or veMEZO yet?

Visit [Mezo Earn](https://mezo.org/docs/users/mezo-earn) to:

- Lock BTC (1-28 days) to receive veBTC

This dual strategy lets you maximize rewards across the entire ecosystem.

## Troubleshooting

### Wallet Won't Connect
