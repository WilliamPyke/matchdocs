description: Step-by-step guide to voting with your veMEZO on Matchbox
---

This guide walks you through the process of using your veMEZO to vote on gauges and earn incentive rewards on Matchbox.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A connected wallet with veMEZO position(s)
- Small amount of BTC for transaction fees
- Understanding of [epochs](/concepts/epochs) and timing

Don't have veMEZO yet? Visit [Mezo Earn](https://mezo.org/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vemezo) to lock MEZO tokens.

## Quick Start

1. Connect your wallet
2. Go to the **Boost** page
3. Select your veMEZO position
4. Browse gauges and their incentives
5. Allocate your voting power
6. Confirm the transaction
7. Return to Dashboard to claim rewards after the epoch

## Step-by-Step Voting Process

### Step 1: Navigate to the Boost Page

From the Matchbox homepage or navigation bar, click **Boost** (or "Vote to Boost").

You'll see the voting interface with:

- Position selector (top)
- Gauge list (main area)
- Your voting summary (sidebar or bottom)

### Step 2: Select Your veMEZO Position

If you have multiple veMEZO NFTs, choose which one to vote with:

1. Look at the **position carousel** at the top
2. Browse through your veMEZO positions
3. Each card shows:
   - Locked MEZO amount
   - Current voting power
   - Lock status and expiry
   - Already-used weight (if any)
4. Click to select the position you want to use

### Step 3: Browse Available Gauges

The main area displays all active gauges. For each gauge, you can see:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Display Name** | Gauge identity |
| **Current APY** | Estimated annual return based on current state |
| **Incentives** | Tokens being offered this epoch |
| **veMEZO Weight** | Total votes already allocated |
| **Boost Level** | Current boost multiplier |

### Step 4: Evaluate Opportunities

Before allocating votes, consider:

#### High APY Gauges

- Higher APY = better potential returns
- But check the competition (total veMEZO weight)
- APY may decrease as more votes come in

#### Under-Boosted Gauges

- Gauges far from 5x boost may offer better value
- Your votes have more impact on their boost
- Often correlates with higher APY

#### Gauge Profiles

Click on a gauge to see:

- Full description and strategy
- Social links and community info
- Historical performance
- Incentive breakdown by token

### Step 5: Allocate Your Votes

Once you've identified target gauges:

1. **Enter allocation percentage** for each gauge
2. Your allocations must sum to 100% (or less if you want to leave some unallocated)
3. Watch the **projected APY** update as you adjust
4. Review your total allocation in the summary panel

#### Allocation Tips

- **Diversify**: Spread across 2-4 gauges to reduce risk
- **Concentrate**: Focus on 1-2 gauges for maximum impact
- **Leave buffer**: You can allocate less than 100% if uncertain

### Step 6: Review and Confirm

Before submitting:

1. Double-check your allocations
2. Verify the projected APY looks reasonable
3. Ensure you're within the voting window (not first/last hour of epoch)
4. Review the transaction details

### Step 7: Submit Your Vote

1. Click the **Vote** or **Submit** button
2. Your wallet will prompt for transaction approval
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Wait for blockchain confirmation
5. Success message confirms your votes are recorded

## After Voting

### Monitor Your Position

On the Dashboard, you can track:

- Your current vote allocations
- Accumulated rewards (updates throughout epoch)
- Projected earnings
- Current APY

### Epoch End

When the epoch ends:

1. Final rewards are calculated
2. Your share of incentives is determined
3. Rewards become claimable

### Claiming Rewards

1. Go to the **Dashboard**
2. Find the **Claimable Rewards** section
3. View your earned incentives by token
4. Click **Claim** to transfer to your wallet
5. Confirm the transaction

## Advanced Voting Strategies

### Strategy 1: APY Chasing

Focus on the highest-APY gauges each epoch.

**Pros:**

- Maximum potential returns
- Simple decision-making

**Cons:**

- High competition may dilute returns
- APY fluctuates throughout epoch

### Strategy 2: Value Hunting

Target gauges with fewer votes but decent incentives.

**Pros:**

- Higher share of incentives
- Your votes matter more

**Cons:**

- Lower total incentive pools
- May require more research

### Strategy 3: Loyalty

Consistently vote for the same gauges each epoch.

**Pros:**

- Build relationships with gauge owners
- May receive additional perks
- Less time-consuming

**Cons:**

- May miss better opportunities elsewhere
- Locked into specific performance

### Strategy 4: Diversified Portfolio

Spread votes across multiple gauges based on different criteria.

**Pros:**

- Reduced risk
- Exposure to multiple opportunities
- Balanced returns

**Cons:**

- Diluted impact per gauge
- More complex to manage

## Voting Best Practices

### Timing

- **Vote early in the epoch** to secure your position
- **Don't wait until the last minute** - voting closes 1 hour before epoch end
- **Set calendar reminders** for each Thursday (epoch start)

### Research

- **Check gauge profiles** before voting
- **Review historical performance** in gauge details
- **Monitor community channels** for gauge updates

### Optimization

- **Compare APY across gauges** before deciding
- **Factor in your voting power** - larger positions may prefer diversification
- **Consider token preferences** - do you want rewards in BTC, MEZO, or other tokens?

### Risk Management

- **Don't over-concentrate** in a single gauge
- **Verify gauge legitimacy** through profiles and socials
- **Start small** if you're new to evaluate performance

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See My veMEZO

- Ensure wallet is connected to Mezo Network
- Verify you have veMEZO positions (lock MEZO on Mezo Earn)
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet

### Vote Transaction Failing

- Check you're within voting window (not first/last hour)
- Ensure sufficient BTC for gas fees
- Verify allocations sum to ≤100%

### APY Lower Than Expected

- More votes came in after you, diluting your share
- Incentive amounts changed
- Price fluctuations in reward tokens

### Missing Rewards

- Wait for epoch to fully transition
- Rewards may take a few minutes to appear
- Check you actually voted (transaction confirmed)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change my vote during an epoch?

Yes, you can reset and reallocate your votes anytime within the voting window.

### What happens if I don't vote?

You receive no incentive rewards for that epoch. Your veMEZO still earns rebase rewards, but you forfeit gauge incentives.

### Do my votes carry over to the next epoch?

No. Votes reset to zero at each epoch start. You must vote every week.

### Can I vote with multiple veMEZO positions?

Yes, select each position separately and allocate its voting power.

### When can I claim my rewards?

After the epoch ends (Thursday 00:00 UTC). Rewards don't expire - claim when convenient.
