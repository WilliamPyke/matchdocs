This guide walks you through setting up and managing your veBTC gauge on Matchbox to attract veMEZO votes and maximize your boost.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A connected wallet with veBTC position(s)
- Small amount of BTC for transaction fees
- Tokens for incentives (BTC, MEZO, or allowlisted tokens)
- Understanding of [gauges](/concepts/gauges) and [epochs](/concepts/epochs)

Don't have veBTC yet? Visit [Mezo Earn](https://mezo.org/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vebtc) to lock BTC.

## Quick Start

1. Connect your wallet
2. Go to the **Incentives** page
3. Select your veBTC position
4. Create your gauge profile
5. Add incentives to attract voters
6. Monitor performance and adjust

## Understanding Your Gauge

Every veBTC position is automatically associated with a gauge. On Matchbox, you can:

- **Customize** your gauge profile to attract voters
- **Add incentives** to encourage veMEZO holders to vote for you
- **Monitor** your gauge's performance and boost level
- **Transfer** your profile if you manage multiple veBTC positions

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the Incentives Page

From the Matchbox homepage or navigation bar, click **Incentives** (or "Manage Gauge").

You'll see the gauge management interface with:

- Position selector (top)
- Profile editor
- Incentive management
- Performance metrics

### Step 2: Select Your veBTC Position

If you have multiple veBTC NFTs:

1. Browse the **position carousel** at the top
2. Each card shows:
   - Locked BTC amount
   - Current voting power
   - Boost multiplier
   - Lock status and expiry
3. Click to select the position you want to manage

### Step 3: Create Your Gauge Profile

A compelling profile helps attract voters. Fill in:

#### Basic Information

| Field | Purpose | Tips |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Display Name** | Identifies your gauge | Make it memorable and brandable |
| **Description** | Explains your purpose | Be clear about what you're building |

Connect your community channels:

- **Twitter/X** - Primary social presence
- **Discord** - Community engagement
- **Telegram** - Quick updates
- **GitHub** - Open source projects
- **Website** - Full information

#### Strategy Statements

Help voters understand your approach:

- **Incentive Strategy** - How you plan to reward voters (e.g., "Consistent weekly incentives in BTC")
- **Voting Strategy** - Your goals and why voters should support you

#### Tags

Add relevant categories:

- DeFi
- Infrastructure
- Gaming
- NFT
- DAO
- etc.

### Step 4: Save Your Profile

1. Review all entered information
2. Click **Save Profile** or **Update Profile**
3. Confirm the transaction (stores on-chain and in database)
4. Your profile is now visible to voters

### Step 5: Add Incentives

Incentives (bribes) attract veMEZO voters to your gauge.

#### Selecting Incentive Token

1. Click **Add Incentive** or similar button
2. Choose your incentive token:
   - **BTC** - Most familiar to voters
   - **MEZO** - Native ecosystem token
   - **Other** - Check the allowlist for approved tokens

#### Setting Incentive Amount

1. Enter the amount you want to offer
2. View the estimated USD value
3. See the projected impact on your gauge's APY
4. Consider weekly vs. one-time amounts

#### Confirming the Incentive

1. Review the incentive details
2. Approve token spending (if first time)
3. Confirm the deposit transaction
4. Incentive is now active on your gauge

### Step 6: Monitor Performance

After setting up your gauge, track its performance:

#### Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **veMEZO Weight** | Total votes you're receiving |
| **Boost Multiplier** | Your current boost level (1x-5x) |
| **Optimal veMEZO** | Target votes for max boost |
| **Current APY** | Voter returns on your gauge |

#### Gauge Detail Page

Visit your gauge on the **Gauges** page to see:

- How you compare to other gauges
- Historical performance trends
- Vote distribution over time
- Incentive effectiveness

## Incentive Strategies

### Strategy 1: Consistent Weekly

Offer the same incentive amount each epoch.

**Pros:**

- Builds voter trust and loyalty
- Predictable costs
- Attracts long-term voters

**Example:** "0.001 BTC every epoch"

### Strategy 2: Competitive Matching

Match or exceed competing gauges' incentives.

**Pros:**

- Stay competitive in the market
- Attract votes from other gauges

**Cons:**

- Can become expensive
- May lead to bidding wars

### Strategy 3: Boost-Targeted

Calculate the exact incentive needed to reach your target boost.

**Pros:**

- Cost-efficient
- Achieves specific goals

**How:**

1. Check your current boost level
2. Calculate votes needed for target boost
3. Set incentive to attract that level of votes

### Strategy 4: Launch Campaign

Start with high incentives, then reduce over time.

**Pros:**

- Attract initial attention
- Build voter base quickly

**Cons:**

- May lose voters when incentives decrease

### Strategy 5: Relationship-Based

Offer incentives plus additional perks (airdrops, access, etc.).

**Pros:**

- Builds community
- Differentiates from pure incentive competition

## Profile Best Practices

### Building Trust

- **Complete all profile fields** - Empty profiles look suspicious
- **Use real social links** - Active accounts show legitimacy
- **Update regularly** - Keep information current
- **Engage with voters** - Respond to questions on social media

### Standing Out

- **Distinctive branding** - Memorable name and image
- **Clear value proposition** - Why should voters choose you?
- **Transparent strategy** - Explain your approach
- **Consistent presence** - Regular updates and engagement

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Minimal profile** - Takes minutes to fill out, big impact on trust
- **Misleading information** - Damages reputation permanently
- **Ignoring voters** - Engagement builds loyalty
- **Inconsistent incentives** - Unpredictability drives voters away

## Transferring Your Profile

If you manage multiple veBTC positions or want to move your gauge:

### When to Transfer

- Consolidating positions
- Lock expiring and creating new one
- Reorganizing your portfolio

### How to Transfer

1. Go to **Incentives** page
2. Select your current gauge
3. Click **Transfer Profile**
4. Select the destination veBTC NFT
5. Confirm the transfer
6. Profile, settings, and history move to new gauge

### What Transfers

- Display name and description
- Profile picture
- Social links
- Strategy statements
- Tags
- Historical reputation

### What Doesn't Transfer

- Pending incentives (must be claimed or wait)
- Active votes (stays with old gauge until epoch end)
- Specific gauge address (new position = new address)

## Optimizing Your Gauge

### Attracting More Votes

1. **Increase incentives** - Direct path to more votes
2. **Improve profile** - Build trust with voters
3. **Promote on social** - Bring attention to your gauge
4. **Engage community** - Build relationships with key voters

### Cost Efficiency

1. **Monitor APY** - Are you overpaying for votes?
2. **Check competition** - What are similar gauges offering?
3. **Target specific boost** - Don't overshoot your needs
4. **Time incentives** - Add early in epoch for full exposure

### Performance Tracking

Check regularly:

- Vote trend (increasing/decreasing)
- Boost multiplier progress
- Cost per vote
- APY competitiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Profile Not Saving

- Ensure wallet is connected
- Check you have BTC for gas
- Try refreshing and reconnecting

### Incentive Transaction Failing

- Verify token approval completed
- Check sufficient token balance
- Ensure within valid epoch period

### Low Vote Attraction

- Compare your APY to competitors
- Review your profile completeness
- Consider increasing incentives
- Promote your gauge on social media

### Boost Not Increasing

- Verify votes are being received
- Check if you've reached optimal veMEZO
- Review the boost calculation formula
- Wait for more voters to allocate

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I offer in incentives?

Start by checking competing gauges. Aim for competitive APY while staying within budget. Monitor and adjust based on results.

### Can I change my profile after creating it?

Yes, update anytime. Changes are visible immediately to voters.

### What if my veBTC expires?

Your gauge becomes inactive. Create a new veBTC lock and transfer your profile to maintain continuity.

### Do incentives roll over if not claimed?

Incentives remain available for the voting period they were deposited for. Check specific rules for unclaimed amounts.

### How do I know if my incentives are working?

Monitor your veMEZO weight and boost multiplier. If they're increasing, your incentives are attracting votes.
