---

veMEZO (voting escrow MEZO) is an NFT that represents your locked MEZO tokens on Mezo Network. While veMEZO doesn't provide independent voting power for governance, it grants the ability to **boost veBTC positions** and earn rewards in the process.

## What is veMEZO?

veMEZO is the key to the boosting mechanism in Mezo Earn. Each veMEZO NFT contains:

- **Locked amount** - How much MEZO you've locked
- **Lock duration** - When your lock expires (1-4 years)
- **Voting power** - Your ability to boost veBTC gauges
- **Used weight** - How much of your voting power is currently allocated
- **Unlock date** - When you can withdraw your MEZO

## How to Obtain veMEZO

You obtain veMEZO by locking MEZO tokens on [Mezo Earn](https://mezo.org/docs/users/mezo-earn/lock/vemezo):

1. Visit Mezo Earn
2. Navigate to the Lock section
3. Select MEZO as the token to lock
4. Choose your lock amount
5. Select your lock duration (1-4 years)
6. Confirm the transaction
7. Receive your veMEZO NFT

### Lock Duration Options

| Duration | Weight Multiplier | Use Case |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **1 year** | 0.25x of max | Minimum commitment |
| **2 years** | 0.5x of max | Medium-term participation |
| **3 years** | 0.75x of max | Stronger commitment |
| **4 years** | 1.0x (maximum) | Maximum voting power |

Longer locks mean more voting power and greater ability to earn rewards.

## Voting Power and Decay

Like veBTC, veMEZO voting power **decays linearly** over time:

**Voting Power = Locked Amount × (Time Remaining / Max Lock Duration)**

### Example

If you lock 1,000 MEZO for 4 years:

- **Year 0**: 1,000 veMEZO voting power
- **Year 2**: 500 veMEZO voting power
- **Year 3**: 250 veMEZO voting power
- **Year 4**: 0 veMEZO (unlock available)

### Maintaining Voting Power

To prevent decay:

- **Extend your lock** - Add time to maintain or increase power
- **Enable auto-max lock** - Automatically maintain maximum lock duration

## How veMEZO Works with veBTC

veMEZO's primary function is to **boost veBTC positions**. Here's how the relationship works:

```
veMEZO Holder                    veBTC Gauge
     │                               │
     │ Allocates voting power       │
     ├──────────────────────────────►│
     │                               │
     │                    Boost increased
     │                               │
     │ Earns bribes                 │ Higher rewards
     ◄──────────────────────────────┤
```

### The Boost Mechanism

1. veBTC holders have a base voting power
2. veMEZO holders vote on veBTC gauges
3. Votes increase the gauge's boost multiplier (up to 5x)
4. Higher boost = more rewards for the veBTC holder
5. In return, veMEZO voters earn incentives from the gauge

## Benefits of Holding veMEZO

### 1. Boost Multiplier for Others

Your veMEZO gives you the power to boost veBTC positions by up to 5x. This makes your voting power valuable in the ecosystem.

### 2. Earn Incentives (Bribes)

Through Matchbox, veBTC gauge owners offer incentives to attract your votes. By voting on their gauges, you earn a proportional share of these bribes.

### 3. Rebase Rewards

veMEZO holders receive weekly MEZO emissions that protect against dilution. The rebase amount depends on:

- Your veMEZO voting power
- Total veMEZO in the system
- Weekly emission schedule

### 4. Passive Income

Beyond active voting rewards, you earn from:

- Protocol fee distributions
- Rebase emissions
- Matchbox incentives

## Using veMEZO on Matchbox

On Matchbox, veMEZO holders can:

### Browse Gauges

View all available gauges with key metrics:

- Total veMEZO weight already voting
- Current boost multiplier
- Available incentives
- Projected APY if you vote

### Allocate Votes

Distribute your voting power across multiple gauges:

1. Select your veMEZO position
2. Choose gauges to support
3. Set percentage allocation for each
4. Confirm your vote transaction

### Monitor Earnings

Track your performance:

- Current APY from your voting allocations
- Earned bribes ready to claim
- Historical performance data

### Claim Rewards

Collect your earned incentives:

1. Visit the Dashboard
2. View claimable rewards
3. Claim to your wallet

## Voting Strategy Considerations

### Diversification vs. Concentration

- **Diversify**: Spread votes across multiple gauges to reduce risk
- **Concentrate**: Focus on high-APY gauges for maximum returns

### Gauge Selection Criteria

When choosing where to vote, consider:

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Incentives offered** | Direct impact on your earnings |
| **Current vote weight** | Higher competition = lower APY per vote |
| **Gauge profile quality** | Indicates serious, long-term operators |
| **Historical performance** | Track record of consistent rewards |

### Timing

- **Vote early in epoch** - Secure your share before competition increases
- **Monitor throughout** - Adjust if better opportunities emerge
- **Don't miss epochs** - Votes reset weekly; non-voting forfeits rewards

## Key Considerations

### Long Lock Periods

veMEZO requires a minimum 1-year lock. Make sure you're comfortable with this commitment before locking.

### No Independent Governance Power

Unlike some protocols, veMEZO doesn't grant standalone governance voting rights. Its power comes from boosting veBTC positions.

### Active Participation Required

To maximize earnings, you need to:

- Vote each epoch
- Monitor gauge performance
- Claim accumulated rewards
