---

A comprehensive reference of terms used in Matchbox and the Mezo Earn ecosystem.

## A

### Allocation

The distribution of your veMEZO voting power across different gauges. You can allocate percentages to multiple gauges, with the total summing to 100% or less.

### APY (Annual Percentage Yield)

The estimated yearly return on your position, accounting for compounding. In Matchbox, APY reflects your projected earnings from voting rewards or gauge incentives, extrapolated over a year.

### Allowlist

A list of approved tokens that can be used as incentives on gauges. Only tokens on the allowlist can be deposited as bribes.

## B

### Boost / Boost Multiplier

The enhancement factor applied to a veBTC position's voting power when it receives veMEZO votes. Boost ranges from 1x (no boost) to 5x (maximum boost). Higher boost means greater rewards for the veBTC holder.

### Bribe

See [Incentive](#incentive).

## C

### Claim

The action of withdrawing earned rewards from the protocol to your wallet. Rewards accumulate over time and can be claimed after each epoch ends.

### Current APY

APY calculated based on the current epoch's actual performance and existing conditions.

## D

### Decay

The gradual reduction of voting power over time as your lock approaches expiration. Both veBTC and veMEZO use linear decay - your power decreases steadily from lock date to unlock date.

### Dashboard

The Matchbox interface showing your portfolio, positions, claimable rewards, and performance metrics.

## E

### Epoch

A 7-day period that structures voting and reward distribution. Epochs run from Thursday 00:00 UTC to the following Wednesday 23:59 UTC. Votes reset at the start of each epoch.

### Effective Voting Power

Your actual voting power after applying boost multiplier. Calculated as: Unboosted Power × Boost Multiplier.

## G

### Gas

Transaction fees paid in BTC on the Mezo Network to execute smart contract operations.

### Gauge

A smart contract associated with a veBTC position that receives votes from veMEZO holders. Gauges can hold incentives and track voting weight.

### Gauge Profile

Customizable information about a gauge on Matchbox, including display name, description, profile picture, social links, and strategy statements.

## I

### Incentive

Tokens offered by veBTC gauge owners to attract veMEZO votes. Also called "bribes." Incentives are distributed proportionally to voters at the end of each epoch.

## L

### Linear Decay

The method by which voting power decreases over time. Power decreases at a constant rate from lock date to unlock date. For example, a 28-day lock loses half its power after 14 days.

### Lock / Lock Duration

The commitment period for your tokens. veBTC locks range from 1-28 days; veMEZO locks range from 1-4 years. Tokens cannot be withdrawn until the lock expires.

## M

### Mats

Mezo's incentive token distributed across the ecosystem. Voting power influences mats emissions to different gauges and pools.

### Matchbox

The veBTC + veMEZO matching protocol that creates a marketplace connecting gauge owners with voters.

### Mezo Earn

The broader yield-generating ecosystem within Mezo, including token locking, voting, liquidity provision, and vaults.

### Mezo Network

The Bitcoin-backed blockchain where Matchbox and Mezo Earn operate.

### MEZO (Token)

The native governance and utility token of the Mezo ecosystem. Lock MEZO to receive veMEZO.

## N

### NFT (Non-Fungible Token)

A unique digital asset on the blockchain. veBTC and veMEZO positions are represented as NFTs, each with unique properties (amount, lock duration, etc.).

## O

### Optimal veMEZO

The calculated amount of veMEZO votes needed for a gauge to reach maximum boost (5x). Displayed on gauge cards to help voters identify high-impact opportunities.

## P

A lock with no expiration date, maintaining maximum voting power indefinitely. Can be enabled for veBTC positions.

### Position

A veBTC or veMEZO NFT representing your locked tokens and associated voting power.

### Profile Picture

The visual identifier for a gauge, uploaded by the gauge owner to help voters recognize it.

### Projected APY

Estimated APY based on your planned actions (e.g., if you vote on a specific gauge), before actually executing the transaction.

## R

### Rebase

Weekly MEZO emissions distributed to veMEZO holders to protect against token dilution. Earned regardless of voting activity.

### Reset

The clearing of all vote allocations at the start of each new epoch. Votes must be recast weekly.

## S

### Social Links

URLs to a gauge's social media presence (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.) displayed on their profile to help voters learn more.

### Strategy Statement

Text written by gauge owners describing their incentive strategy or voting strategy, displayed on their profile.

## T

### Tags

Category labels applied to gauge profiles (e.g., "DeFi," "Infrastructure") to help voters discover relevant gauges.

### Token ID

The unique identifier of a veBTC or veMEZO NFT on the blockchain.

### Total Weight

The sum of all veMEZO votes allocated to a specific gauge.

### Transfer Profile

The action of moving a gauge's profile settings (name, picture, links, etc.) from one veBTC NFT to another.

## U

### Unboosted Voting Power

### Unlock Date

The date when your locked tokens become withdrawable. For veBTC, 1-28 days from lock; for veMEZO, 1-4 years from lock.

### Used Weight

The portion of your veMEZO voting power currently allocated to gauge votes. Remaining power is "available."

## V

### veBTC (Voting Escrow BTC)

An NFT representing locked Bitcoin on Mezo Network. Grants voting power in governance and receives boost from veMEZO votes.

### veMEZO (Voting Escrow MEZO)

An NFT representing locked MEZO tokens on Mezo Network. Grants voting power to boost veBTC positions and earn incentives.

### Voting Escrow

A mechanism where tokens are locked for a period in exchange for governance power. The longer the lock, the more power granted.

### Voting Power

Your influence in the system, determined by the amount locked and time remaining on your lock. Used to vote on gauges (veMEZO) or participate in governance (veBTC).

### Voting Window

The time period during an epoch when votes can be cast. Open from Thursday 01:00 UTC to Wednesday 23:00 UTC (excludes first and last hour of epoch).
